This is a small (3.2kb minified) library to help working with arrays of notes or intervals in a functional way.

This is part of [music.kit](https://github.com/danigb/music.kit) library, a full library to work with musical abstractions. It uses [array.notation](https://github.com/danigb/array-notation) to represent notes and intervals in strings.

## Install

__Not released yet. I will be available via npm__

## Usage

You can read the [API documentation here](https://github.com/danigb/music.gamut/blob/master/API.md)

Probably you will want some high level modules than this one. See [music.kit](https://github.com/danigb/music.kit)
